### This script was made out of spite.

Allow me to explain. I was tested constantly during my time here, and I really missed being in a terminal the entire time. My only hope was to live in my WSL terminal. As a result I'd show my work through various bits of `grep` and `awk` output. I then later learned that all of the testing that was done against me was for naught, as Notepad++ was the preferred... "log parser"... at this establishment.

By about the fourth time that I heard "You know, Notepad++ would be faster", my inner monologue decided that was the final "JUST DO A `grep -R`, WHAT DO YOU MEAN." This script was then born.

Now:
1. Could this have been done in a different language?

    ABSOLUTELY. Though I wanted to prove a point

2. Did this increase your productivity (during your time there)?

    ABSOLUTELY. After you get one REALLY nasty `grep` or `awk` out, the feeling is so good. Rather than keeping it in a personal wiki (like I used to do), I threw it in there instead. I gave the output colors for mental stimulation.

3. Okay but why?

    See Question 1.

This is no longer in use. I was not at that establishment for long. This was how I kept sane, and everything about this script made me really happy.

Of note there is a long section with ASCII Art. That is intentional -- I was snooped on constantly and I really wanted to drive home the point of "stop testing my bash if you can't run a script yourself". This happened often.

Thank you for listening to my rant. I will never update this again, but I do look at it occasionally because I did some very funny stuff in this script that brings a tear to my eye.
